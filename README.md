## About

This is a very basic informational site that contains 4 pages:

- index.html
- about.html
- contact-me.html and
- 404.html
- And a JavaScript file to serve the pages (index.js)
  This is not meant in any way to be pretty; it's all about functionality. The goal is to learn and practice how to use Node JS as a backend.

I also added a module, nodemon, to monitor any changes in the server. This is so I wouldn't have to end and restart the server to see changes in code.
